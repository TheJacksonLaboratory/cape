Description: 
    Combined Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis infers predictive networks between
    genetic variants and phenotypes. It can be used with standard two-parent 
    populations as well as multi-parent populations, such as the Diversity 
    Outbred (DO) mice, Collaborative Cross (CC) mice, or the multi-parent advanced
    generation intercross (MAGIC) population of Arabidopsis thaliana. It
    uses complementary information of pleiotropic gene variants across different
    phenotypes to resolve models of epistatic interactions between alleles. To
    do this, cape reparameterizes main effect and interaction coefficients from
    pairwise variant regressions into directed influence parameters. These
    parameters describe how alleles influence each other, in terms of suppression 
    and enhancement, as well as how gene variants influence phenotypes. All of the 
    final interactions are reported as directed interactions between pairs of 
    parental alleles. For detailed descriptions of the methods used in this package
